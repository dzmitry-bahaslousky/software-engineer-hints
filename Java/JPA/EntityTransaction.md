`EntityTransaction` is an interface in the Java Persistence API (JPA) that manages transactions within the context of an [[EntityManager]]. It provides methods for beginning, committing, and rolling back transactions, ensuring that operations on entities are handled in a transactional manner.

## Key Responsibilities of `EntityTransaction`:

1. **Beginning a Transaction (`begin`)**:
    - The `begin()` method starts a new transaction. Once this is called, all changes made to entities are grouped within this transaction and are not immediately persisted to the database.
2. **Committing a Transaction (`commit`)**:
    - The `commit()` method completes the current transaction, saving all changes made to the entities to the database. If the transaction completes successfully, the data is permanently recorded.
3. **Rolling Back a Transaction (`rollback`)**:
    - The `rollback()` method undoes all changes made within the current transaction. If an error occurs during the transaction, this method restores the system to the state it was in before the transaction began.
4. **Checking Transaction Status (`isActive`)**:
    - The `isActive()` method checks whether a transaction is currently active. This is useful for determining if a transaction has been started and whether it can be committed or rolled back.
5. **Marking a Transaction for Rollback (`setRollbackOnly`)**:
    - The `setRollbackOnly()` method marks the current transaction as requiring a rollback. After this is called, any attempt to commit the transaction will result in a rollback instead.
6. **Checking Rollback Status (`getRollbackOnly`)**:
    - The `getRollbackOnly()` method checks whether the current transaction has been marked for rollback. This helps in understanding whether the transaction can still be committed successfully or if it must be rolled back.

## Example

```java
EntityManager em = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();

try {
    tx.begin(); // Start the transaction
    // Operations on entities
    tx.commit(); // Commit the transaction
} catch (Exception e) {
    if (tx.isActive()) {
        tx.rollback(); // Rollback the transaction in case of an error
    }
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    em.close(); // Close the EntityManager
}
```
