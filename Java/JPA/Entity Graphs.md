`@NamedEntityGraph` is an annotation in the Java Persistence API (JPA) that allows developers to define a fetch graph for entities, specifying how related entities should be loaded alongside the primary entity in a query. This helps optimize data retrieval and reduce the number of database queries, particularly by avoiding the [[N + 1]] select problem.

## Key Concepts of `@NamedEntityGraph`:

1. **Entity Graphs**:
   An entity graph is a blueprint that specifies which attributes of an entity should be eagerly fetched when the entity is retrieved from the database. It helps in optimizing queries by minimizing the number of round-trips to the database.

2. **Named Graph**:
   The `@NamedEntityGraph` annotation defines a graph that can be referenced by a unique name. This named graph can then be applied to queries to control how associated entities are fetched.

3. **Attributes**:
   Within an entity graph, you can specify which attributes (fields or relationships) of the entity should be included in the graph using `@NamedAttributeNode`.

4. **Subgraphs**:
   Subgraphs allow for nested fetching, where you can define fetch graphs for related entities (associations) that themselves have associations. This helps in handling complex entity structures.

## Parameters of `@NamedEntityGraph`:

- **`name`**:
  The unique name of the entity graph. This name is used to reference the graph when applying it to a query.
  
- **`attributeNodes`**:
  An array of `@NamedAttributeNode` annotations, which specify the attributes of the entity that should be fetched. Each `@NamedAttributeNode` corresponds to a field or relationship of the entity.
  
- **`subgraphs`**:
  An array of `@NamedSubgraph` annotations, which define subgraphs for fetching related entities. Subgraphs allow for specifying fetch strategies for nested relationships.
  
- **`includeAllAttributes`**:
  A boolean value that indicates whether all attributes of the entity should be included in the fetch graph by default. If set to `true`, all attributes are fetched unless explicitly excluded.

## Example

```java
@Entity
@NamedEntityGraph(
    name = "Order.withCustomerAndItems",
    attributeNodes = {
        @NamedAttributeNode("customer"),
        @NamedAttributeNode("orderItems")
    }
)
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Customer customer;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "order")
    private List<OrderItem> orderItems;
    
    // Getters and setters...
}
```

### Applying the Named Entity Graph in a Query

To apply this graph in a query, you would do something like this:
```java
EntityGraph<?> entityGraph = entityManager.getEntityGraph("Order.withCustomerAndItems");

List<Order> orders = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT o FROM Order o", Order.class)
.setHint("javax.persistence.fetchgraph", entityGraph)
.getResultList();
```

## Benefits

- **Optimized Fetching**:
  By specifying which relationships should be eagerly loaded, you can optimize performance by reducing the number of queries needed to retrieve related data.
  
- **Flexibility**:
  You can define multiple named entity graphs for different use cases and apply them as needed, providing flexibility in how data is fetched depending on the context.

- **Compatibility**:
  Entity graphs are part of the JPA specification, making them compatible with various JPA implementations like Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc.
