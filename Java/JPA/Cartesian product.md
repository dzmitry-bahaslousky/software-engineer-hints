**Cartesian product** is a mathematical operation that returns all possible combinations of elements from two or more sets. In the context of databases, a Cartesian product occurs when an SQL query performs a `JOIN` without a join condition (`ON` or `WHERE`), resulting in every row of one table being combined with every row of another table.
