The **N + 1 problem** is a performance issue that occurs in applications interacting with databases, particularly when using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks. The problem arises when an application executes too many database queries to accomplish a single task, leading to significant performance degradation.

## How the N + 1 Problem Occurs

Imagine you have two related entities: **Users** and **Orders**. Suppose you want to fetch a list of all users along with their orders.

1. **First Query (1)**: The application performs a query to retrieve all users.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Let's say this query returns 10 users.

2. **N Additional Queries**: For each user, the application then performs a separate query to fetch that userâ€™s orders.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 2;
...
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 10;
```

As a result, instead of running one or two queries, the application executes **N + 1 queries**, where N is the number of users.

## Why Is It a Problem?

The **N + 1 problem** leads to a large number of database queries, significantly slowing down the application, especially when working with large datasets. It increases the load on the database and the network, making the application inefficient and sluggish.

## How to Resolve the N + 1 Problem

1. **Using JOINs**: Instead of executing multiple queries, you can use a SQL `JOIN` to retrieve all the necessary data in a single query.

```sql
SELECT users.*, orders.* FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

2. **Eager Loading**: In ORM, eager loading can be used to load related entities in a single query, preventing multiple database round trips.
3. **Caching**: Implementing caching strategies can reduce the need to repeatedly query the database for the same data.
4. **Batch Loading**: Some ORM frameworks support batch loading, which allows combining several queries into one.
