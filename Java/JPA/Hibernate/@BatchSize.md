The `@BatchSize` annotation in Hibernate is used to optimize batch fetching of related entities or collections that helps with [[N + 1]] problem. It helps reduce the number of database queries when loading associated data, particularly when lazy fetching (`FetchType.LAZY`) is used.

## How `@BatchSize` Works:

1. **With Collections**: When `@BatchSize` is applied to a collection (e.g., `List`, `Set`), Hibernate will load the elements of that collection in batches of the specified size. This reduces the number of queries executed when accessing the collection elements related to the main entity.
   
```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "user", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @BatchSize(size = 10)
    private List<Order> orders;
}
```

In this example, when you load users and access their orders, Hibernate will fetch the orders in batches of 10. This means that instead of executing one query per order, it will execute a single query to fetch up to 10 orders at a time.

2. **With Entities**: When `@BatchSize` is applied at the entity level (class level), it tells Hibernate to load instances of that class in batches of the specified size when they are fetched by their identifiers.
   
```java
@Entity
@BatchSize(size = 20)
public class Order {
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private User user;
}
```

In this example, if multiple orders are loaded simultaneously and they all belong to the same user, Hibernate will fetch the user data in batches of 20, rather than executing separate queries for each user.

## Benefits of Using `@BatchSize`:

- **Reduction in Number of Queries**: Instead of executing a query for each entity or collection element, Hibernate fetches them in batches, which reduces database load.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces the number of network operations, speeding up query execution and response times.
