In **Modular Monolithic Architecture**, transaction management is simpler compared to distributed systems, as everything runs within a single application and typically uses a shared database. The transaction boundaries are easier to manage, but careful consideration is still required to ensure consistency and maintain modularity.

### Key aspects of transaction management in Modular Monolithic Architecture:

1. **Single database transactions**:
    - Since all modules typically share the same database, a single transaction can span multiple operations across different modules. Most often, this is managed using ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles within the context of a relational database.
2. **Transaction boundaries within a module**:
    - Each module should be responsible for managing its own transactions. When a module performs a set of operations (e.g., create, update, delete), these should be wrapped in a single transaction to ensure atomicity.
3. **Cross-module transactions**:
    - If multiple modules are involved in a single business process, it's important to avoid directly coupling their transactional logic. Instead, transaction coordination can be handled by a higher-level service or a facade that orchestrates calls to various modules while managing the transaction.
4. **Transactional consistency**:
    - Using the same transaction manager across the entire application ensures consistency. If an operation across multiple modules fails, the transaction can be rolled back to maintain data integrity.
5. **Compensating transactions**:
    - In some cases, if cross-module transactions become too complex or introduce coupling, it might be better to use **compensating transactions**, where each module performs its work independently, and in the event of a failure, compensating actions are triggered to undo any partial changes.
6. **Using frameworks**:
    - Many frameworks (like Spring, with its `@Transactional` annotation) simplify transaction management by handling transaction propagation, rollback, and isolation automatically within a modular monolithic system.

### Example:

In an e-commerce system, when a user places an order, the **Order** module initiates a transaction. This transaction could involve updating the order status, checking the inventory in the **Inventory** module, and adjusting the stock levels. If any step fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to avoid data inconsistency.

### Best Practices:

- **Limit cross-module transactions**: Keep transactions within a single module whenever possible.
- **Use orchestration**: For complex operations involving multiple modules, orchestrate the transaction management at a higher service level.
- **Ensure consistency**: Use a transaction manager to maintain consistency across operations.

In summary, transaction management in **Modular Monolithic Architecture** is relatively straightforward but requires careful structuring to ensure data consistency, especially when multiple modules are involved.
