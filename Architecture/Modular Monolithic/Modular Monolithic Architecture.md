**Modular Monolithic Architecture** is an architectural approach that involves building a modular system within a single monolithic application. In this architecture, the application is divided into independent modules, each with its own responsibilities and minimal dependencies on other modules.

### Key characteristics of Modular Monolithic Architecture:

1. **Modularity**:
    - The application consists of multiple modules, each responsible for a distinct piece of business logic or functionality. These modules are isolated within the same codebase (e.g., using packages or modules in the programming language).
2. **Single deployment**:
    - All modules run within a single process, and the application is deployed as one unit, despite the modular structure.
3. **Clear boundaries between modules**:
    - Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces, reducing coupling and increasing maintainability.
4. **Scalability within a monolith**:
    - The modular structure improves flexibility and scalability without the need to transition to a microservices architecture.
5. **Shared database**:
    - Like a traditional monolith, modules may use a shared database, but access to data can be limited to specific modules to maintain isolation.
