**Modular Monolithic Architecture** is suitable in the following scenarios:

1. **Small to medium-sized applications**:
    - When you're developing an application that doesn’t require the complexity of microservices but still needs clear modularization for better organization and maintainability.
2. **Limited team size**:
    - For small development teams, it's easier to manage a single codebase with well-defined modules rather than the complexity of maintaining multiple microservices.
3. **Simplified deployment**:
    - When you want a simple deployment process where the entire application is deployed as one unit, avoiding the overhead of managing and deploying multiple services.
4. **Early stages of a project**:
    - If you're in the early stages of a project and don’t yet need the full flexibility of microservices, but want to prepare for possible future scaling by keeping the system modular.
5. **Lower operational complexity**:
    - When the focus is on minimizing the operational complexity of distributed systems, such as handling service discovery, network latency, and failure management, which are common in microservices architectures.
6. **Consistency in technology stack**:
    - When you want to enforce a unified technology stack across all modules, making it easier to maintain consistency and avoid the complexities of polyglot persistence or different frameworks.
7. **Performance concerns**:
    - If inter-service communication latency in a distributed microservices system would negatively impact performance, a modular monolithic approach avoids network overhead by keeping everything within a single process.
8. **Planned gradual migration**:
    - When you're planning for eventual migration to microservices but want to start with a simpler structure that can be incrementally split into services as the application grows.
