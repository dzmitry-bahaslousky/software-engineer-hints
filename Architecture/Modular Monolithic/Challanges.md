The main **challenges of Modular Monolithic Architecture** include:

1. **Limited scalability**:
    - The entire system is deployed as a single application, making it difficult to scale individual modules. If one module requires more resources, the entire application must be scaled.
2. **Deployment difficulties**:
    - Any change to a single module requires rebuilding and redeploying the whole application, which can increase deployment time and the risk of errors.
3. **Potential code complexity**:
    - Over time, the monolith can become large and difficult to manage, especially if module boundaries are not strictly enforced.
4. **Long-term maintenance challenges**:
    - As the application grows, managing dependencies between modules can become harder, leading to the risk of module isolation breakdown and making long-term maintenance more difficult.
5. **Challenges in migrating to microservices**:
    - Even with modularity, extracting modules into separate services can require significant effort, as they still run in the same process space and often share resources like a common database.
6. **Limited technological flexibility**:
    - All modules must use the same technology stack and framework versions, restricting the ability to use different technologies for individual modules.
7. **Performance bottlenecks**:
    - A problematic module can impact the performance of the entire application since all modules run in the same process.
8. **Risk of tight coupling**:
    - If not properly isolated, modules may become tightly coupled, making it harder to modify and evolve the system.
