**Scalability** is the ability of a system, network, or process to increase its performance and handle growing amounts of work or requests by adding resources. Scalability allows organizations to adapt to changes in load, users, or data while maintaining efficiency and performance.

### Key Aspects of Scalability:

1. **[[Horizontal Scaling]]**:
    
    - This involves adding more nodes or instances to a system to distribute the load. For example, adding new servers to a cluster.
    - **Advantages**: It allows handling more requests and increases fault tolerance.
2. **[[Vertical Scaling]]**:
    
    - This refers to increasing the resources of a single node, such as adding processors, memory, or disk space.
    - **Advantages**: It simplifies management and does not require changing the application architecture.
3. **Software Scalability**:
    
    - This is the ability of an application to efficiently handle an increasing number of users or data without significant performance degradation.
    - It may involve code and architecture optimization.
4. **Network Scalability**:
    
    - This is the ability of a network to support an increase in traffic by adding new devices or increasing bandwidth.

### Examples of Scalability:

- A web application that can handle 100 users but, after scaling, can handle 10,000 users by adding new servers.
- A database that can increase the volume of stored data by adding new disk space or servers.

### Why Scalability is Important:

- **Business Growth**: It allows companies to grow and adapt to increasing demand without significant changes to infrastructure.
- **Efficiency**: It simplifies resource management and reduces maintenance costs.
- **Resilience**: It enhances the reliability and availability of systems, especially during peak loads.
