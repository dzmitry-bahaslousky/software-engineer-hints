A **Load Balancer** is a device or software application that distributes incoming network traffic and workloads across multiple servers or resources. Its primary purpose is to ensure efficient resource utilization, prevent overload on individual servers, and maintain high availability and reliability of applications.

### Key Functions of a Load Balancer:

1. **Load Distribution**: A load balancer evenly distributes traffic among multiple servers, helping to avoid overloading a single node.

2. **High Availability**: In the event of a server failure, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining operational servers, ensuring continuous availability of the application.

3. **Health Monitoring**: Load balancers typically perform health checks on servers and automatically exclude non-functional nodes from the list of available resources for handling requests.

### Types of Load Balancers:

1. **Hardware Load Balancers**: Specialized devices designed to handle large volumes of traffic. They tend to be more expensive and complex.

2. **Software Load Balancers**: Software-based solutions that can run on standard servers (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy).

3. **Cloud Load Balancers**: Services provided by cloud providers that offer load balancing in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer).

### Types of Load Balancing Algorithms:

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially across the server pool.
- **Least Connections**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Routes requests based on the client's IP address, ensuring consistent routing for the same client.
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Assigns weights to servers based on their capacity and distributes traffic accordingly.
