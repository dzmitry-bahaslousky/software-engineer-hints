# [[Scalability]]

The ability of a system to handle increasing workloads or numbers of users without significant performance degradation. A scalable system should effectively adapt to changing demands, whether through resource addition (horizontal or vertical scaling) or optimization of code and infrastructure.

# Usability

The ease and simplicity of user interaction with the system. It includes an intuitive interface, accessibility of features, ergonomics, and user training. The goal is to minimize the effort required to complete tasks and ensure a positive user experience.

# Availability

The percentage of time the system is accessible for user operations. High availability (e.g., 99.9% and above) means the system experiences minimal downtime, allowing users to access it almost at all times.

# Reliability

The ability of a system to perform its functions without failures over a specified period. A reliable system should be resilient to failures and have mechanisms for recovery with minimal data loss and downtime.

# Maintainability

The ease with which a system can be supported, modified, corrected, and updated. This includes code quality, documentation accessibility, system modularity, and the ability to make changes quickly and safely without disrupting operation.

# Efficiency

The optimal use of system resources (such as CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth) to achieve its goals. An efficient system performs tasks with minimal resource expenditure while ensuring the necessary level of performance and quality.
