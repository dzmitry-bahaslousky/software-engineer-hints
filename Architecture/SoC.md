**SoC (Separation of Concerns)** is a software design principle that involves dividing a program into distinct sections, each responsible for a specific aspect or functionality of the system. The main idea is to isolate different "concerns" of a program from one another, making the system more organized, understandable, and easier to maintain.

## Key Aspects of the SoC Principle:

1. **Division of Responsibilities**:
    - The program is divided into modules or components, each responsible for a specific task. For example, the user interface, business logic, and data access should be separated from each other.
2. **Modularity**:
    - SoC leads to a modular system, which simplifies development, testing, and maintenance, as changes in one module don't affect others.
3. **Increased Flexibility**:
    - SoC allows individual components of the system to be modified or replaced without needing to rewrite the entire application.
4. **Improved Code Readability and Comprehension**:
    - When each component of the system is responsible for one task, the code becomes more understandable and easier to analyze and maintain.
5. **Enhanced Testability**:
    - Modules that follow the SoC principle are easier to test independently, improving the overall reliability of the system.

### Examples of SoC in Practice:

1. **[[Layered (N-Layer) Architecture|Layered Architecture]]**:
    - SoC is well-implemented in layered architecture, where different layers of an application are separated by function, such as presentation, logic, and data access.
2. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:
    - In the MVC design pattern, SoC is applied by dividing the code into three components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (business logic).
3. **Microservices Architecture**:
    - In microservices architecture, SoC is implemented by dividing the system into independent services, each responsible for a specific task.
