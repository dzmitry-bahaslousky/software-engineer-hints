**Monolithic Architecture** is a software design approach where all components and functional modules of an application are combined into a single, unified entity. Here are the main characteristics of monolithic architecture:

## 1. **Single Codebase**

All parts of the application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access, reside in one code repository.

## 2. **Complex Deployment**

Since all components are interlinked, deploying changes or updates requires redeploying the entire application, which can introduce compatibility and stability risks.

## 3. **Scaling Challenges**

Scaling a monolithic application typically involves duplicating the entire application rather than scaling individual components, which can be inefficient.

## 4. **Dependencies** 

All modules are dependent on each other, making it difficult to change or replace one module without impacting others.

## 5. **Development Simplicity** 

For small teams and straightforward applications, monolithic architecture can be easier to develop and manage since there is no need for complex infrastructure for microservices.

## 6. **Performance** 

Monolithic architecture often exhibits high performance because all components are in a single process and can interact efficiently.

## Advantages of Monolithic Architecture:

- **Simplicity in Development and Testing**: Having a single codebase makes project management easier.
- **Better Performance**: Interactions between components are faster since they reside in the same process.

## Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture:

- **Difficulty in Changing and Scaling**: Changes in one module can affect the entire application.
- **Long Deployment Times**: Each update requires redeploying the entire application.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Challenges in using different technologies and programming languages for different parts of the application.
