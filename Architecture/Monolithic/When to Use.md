**[[Monolithic architecture]]** is suitable in the following cases:

1. **Small to Medium Applications**: If the application is not overly complex and has a limited number of functions, a monolithic architecture can be simpler and faster to develop.

2. **Limited Resources**: When the development team is small or there are insufficient resources to support a complex microservices infrastructure.

3. **Quick Time to Market**: If rapid deployment is required, monolithic architecture can help minimize development and testing time.

4. **Low Scalability Requirements**: If the application does not anticipate significant growth in load or user numbers, a monolithic solution can be more effective.

5. **Homogeneous Technologies**: When all parts of the application can be developed in the same technology, simplifying integration and code management.
