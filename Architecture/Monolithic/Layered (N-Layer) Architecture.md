**Layered (N-Layer) Architecture** is a design pattern used in software development where an application is organized into multiple layers or tiers, each with a specific responsibility. This structure helps in managing the complexity of [[Monolithic Architecture|large systems]] by separating concerns and promoting modularity.

## Key Layers in N-Layer Architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - **Responsibility**: This is the user interface layer, where interaction with the user occurs. It handles all user input and output, including displaying information and capturing user actions.
    - **Example**: Web pages, desktop UI forms, or mobile app screens.
2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**:
    - **Responsibility**: This layer contains the core functionality and business rules of the application. It processes the data received from the Presentation Layer and applies the business logic before sending it to the Data Layer or back to the user.
    - **Example**: Calculating taxes, processing orders, or validating user input.
3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**:
    - **Responsibility**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any other form of persistent storage. It handles the reading and writing of data, ensuring that the business logic does not directly interact with the data source.
    - **Example**: SQL queries, data models, or APIs to access the database.
4. **Data Layer**:
    - **Responsibility**: Sometimes considered part of the DAL or as a separate layer, this layer represents the actual data storage systems, such as databases, file systems, or external data sources.
    - **Example**: SQL Server, MongoDB, or a cloud storage service.

### Advantages of Layered Architecture:

1. **[[SoC|Separation of Concerns]]**:
    - Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the application, which simplifies development and maintenance.
2. **Modularity**:
    - Changes in one layer, such as the database, do not necessarily affect other layers, like the business logic or presentation, as long as the interfaces between layers remain consistent.
3. **Reusability**:
    - Components within a layer can often be reused across different parts of the application or in different projects.
4. **Testability**:
    - Layers can be tested independently. For example, the business logic can be tested without needing to interact with the user interface or the database.
5. **Maintainability**:
    - The separation of responsibilities makes it easier to locate and fix bugs, extend features, or refactor the application without affecting the entire system.

### Disadvantages of Layered Architecture:

1. **Performance Overhead**:
    - The additional layers can introduce performance overhead due to the added complexity of navigating through multiple layers.
2. **Increased Complexity**:
    - While the architecture simplifies the development of large systems, it can add unnecessary complexity for smaller projects.
3. **Rigid Structure**:
    - Adhering strictly to the layers can sometimes limit flexibility, especially if the architecture is over-engineered for a simple application.
