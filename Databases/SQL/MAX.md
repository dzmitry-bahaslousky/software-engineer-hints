The `MAX` function in SQL is an aggregate function that returns the largest value from a specified column in a table. It is frequently used with [[SELECT]] in data analysis and reporting to determine the highest value within a dataset.

## How `MAX` Works

- **Calculation**: The `MAX` function scans the specified column and retrieves the highest value found. Any `NULL` values in the column are ignored in the calculation.

## Important Notes

1. **Ignoring NULL Values**: The `MAX` function does not consider `NULL` values when determining the maximum. If all values in the column are `NULL`, the function will return `NULL`.

2. **Use in Grouping**: The `MAX` function can also be used with the `GROUP BY` clause to find maximum values for different groups of data. For example, if you want to find the maximum price of products by category, you can write:
```sql
SELECT category, MAX(price) AS maximum_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

3. **Performance**: Like other aggregate functions, `MAX` can have performance implications on large datasets, especially if appropriate indexes are not in place.
