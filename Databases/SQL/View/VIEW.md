A **view** in SQL is a virtual table that represents the result of a query. It does not store data physically but only retains the [[SELECT|SQL query]] used to fetch the data. Views allow users to interact with data in a database more conveniently and securely by providing an abstraction layer over the underlying tables.

### Key Points:

1. **Virtual Table**: A view does not hold data; it generates data on-the-fly when accessed.
2. **Simplification of Complex Queries**: It helps simplify complex queries by hiding implementation details.
3. **Security**: It allows restricting access to specific columns or rows, showing only the necessary data.
4. **Updatability**: Some views can be updatable, allowing users to modify data in the underlying tables through the view if certain conditions are met.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
