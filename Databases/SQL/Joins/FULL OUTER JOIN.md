A **FULL OUTER JOIN** combines the results of both **LEFT OUTER JOIN** and **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**. It returns all rows from both tables and matches them wherever possible. If there is no match, the result will include `NULL` for the columns of the table that does not have a matching row.

### Key Points:

1. **All Rows from Both Tables**: The result set includes all rows from the left table and all rows from the right table.
2. **Matching Rows**: If there is a match based on the join condition, the corresponding values from both tables are included in the result.
3. **NULL for Non-Matches**: If a row from the left table does not have a matching row in the right table, or vice versa, the result will include `NULL` for the columns of the table that does not have the match.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### Use Cases:

- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: When you need to see all data from both tables, regardless of whether there is a match.
- **Data Analysis**: Useful for reporting purposes where you want to analyze relationships between two datasets, including non-matching records.

### Performance Considerations:

- **Efficiency**: Similar to other joins, but `FULL OUTER JOIN` can be more computationally intensive since it combines results from both sides.
- **NULL Values**: Handling of `NULL` values can complicate data processing.
