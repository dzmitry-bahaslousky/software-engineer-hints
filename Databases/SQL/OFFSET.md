The `OFFSET` clause in SQL is used with [[SELECT]] to specify the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the query result. It is commonly used in conjunction with the [[LIMIT]] clause (or its equivalent) to facilitate pagination, allowing users to retrieve data in manageable chunks.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number OFFSET offset_value;
```

## Applications

- **Pagination**: The primary use of `OFFSET` is in implementing pagination in applications. It allows users to view results in pages instead of loading all data at once.
- **Selective Data Retrieval**: `OFFSET` can be used to retrieve specific subsets of data from large result sets, improving performance and user experience.

## Important Notes

- The `OFFSET` clause is not supported in all database systems. However, it is commonly used in databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- In SQL Server, you can achieve similar functionality using the `OFFSET ... FETCH NEXT` syntax.
- When using `OFFSET`, it is important to have an `ORDER BY` clause to ensure consistent results, especially when dealing with large datasets, as the order of the rows may not be guaranteed without it.
