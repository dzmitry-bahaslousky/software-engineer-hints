The `DELETE` statement in SQL is used to remove one or more records from a database table. It allows for the manipulation of data by enabling the removal of unwanted or outdated entries. Here are the key aspects and functionalities of the `DELETE` statement:

## Key Aspects of the DELETE Statement

1. **Deleting Records**:
	- The primary function of the `DELETE` statement is to remove rows from a specified table based on defined conditions.
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 5;
```

2. **Conditional Deletion**:
	- The `DELETE` statement is typically used with a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be deleted. If the `WHERE` clause is omitted, all records in the table will be deleted.
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 3;
```

3. **Deleting All Records**:
	- To delete all records from a table, the `DELETE` statement can be executed without a `WHERE` clause.
```sql
DELETE FROM employees;
```

4. **Limiting the Number of Deleted Rows**:
	- Some database management systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, allow the use of the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of rows deleted in a single operation.
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 3 LIMIT 5;
```

5. **Data Recovery**:
	- Once the `DELETE` command is executed, recovering the deleted data can be challenging if no backup or transaction management is in place.
