The `ORDER BY` clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns. It allows you to organize the retrieved data in either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order based on the values in specified columns. By default, if no order is specified, the sorting is done in ascending order.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

## Use Cases

- **Display Data in a Specific Order:** For example, displaying the top-performing sales representatives by sales amount.
- **Pagination:** When combined with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`, `ORDER BY` can be used to fetch specific "pages" of data, such as the top 10 most expensive products.
- **Ranking Data:** Sorting data to rank records, such as showing the top 5 students by grade.

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexes:** Sorting on columns that are indexed can improve performance, as the database can quickly access and order the data.
- **Multiple Columns:** Sorting by multiple columns or by expressions can increase complexity and slow down query performance, especially on large datasets.
- **Large Datasets:** Sorting very large datasets can be resource-intensive, potentially requiring significant memory and CPU time.
