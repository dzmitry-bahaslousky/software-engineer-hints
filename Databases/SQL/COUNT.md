The `COUNT` function in SQL is an aggregate function used with [[SELECT]] that returns the total number of rows that match a specified condition in a query. It is widely used in data analysis to determine how many entries exist in a dataset.

## How `COUNT` Works

- **Basic Calculation**: The `COUNT` function counts the number of rows in a result set. It can be applied to all rows or to a specific column, depending on the context.

## Important Notes

1. **NULL Handling**: `COUNT(column_name)` will not include `NULL` values in its count, while `COUNT(*)` includes all rows regardless of `NULL` values.

2. **Use with GROUP BY**: The `COUNT` function can also be used with the `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of occurrences for each group. For example, to count the number of employees in each department:

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

3. **Performance**: The `COUNT` function is efficient for counting rows, but its performance can depend on the size of the dataset and the presence of indexes.
