The `UNIQUE` constraint in a database is a rule that ensures the values stored in a column, or a combination of columns, are distinct from each other. It prevents duplicate entries in the specified column(s), thereby maintaining the integrity of the data. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

## Key Characteristics of the `UNIQUE` Constraint:

1. **Ensures Uniqueness**:
    - The primary purpose of the `UNIQUE` constraint is to make sure that no two rows in the table have the same value(s) in the specified column or columns. For instance, if you apply a `UNIQUE` constraint to the `email` column of a `users` table, it ensures that no two users can have the same email address.

2. **Multiple `UNIQUE` Constraints**:
    - Unlike the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint, which can only be applied once per table, a table can have multiple `UNIQUE` constraints. This allows you to enforce uniqueness on multiple columns or combinations of columns. For example, you might enforce uniqueness on both the `email` and `username` columns independently.

3. **Handling Multiple Columns (Composite Unique)**:
    - You can apply a `UNIQUE` constraint to a combination of columns (a composite key). In this case, the uniqueness is enforced on the combination of values across these columns. For example, if you have a `UNIQUE` constraint on the combination of `first_name` and `last_name`, the same pair of `first_name` and `last_name` cannot be repeated in any row, but individual `first_name` or `last_name` values can be duplicated as long as the pair is unique.

4. **Differences from `PRIMARY KEY`**:
    - While both `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraints ensure uniqueness, there are some differences:
        - A table can have only one `PRIMARY KEY` but can have multiple `UNIQUE` constraints.
        - `PRIMARY KEY` implicitly includes a `NOT NULL` constraint, meaning the columns in a primary key cannot contain `NULL` values. In contrast, columns under a `UNIQUE` constraint can contain `NULL` values, but this depends on the database system’s implementation. In many systems, `NULL` is considered a distinct value, meaning multiple `NULL`s are allowed under a `UNIQUE` constraint.

5. **Enforcement by the Database**:
    - When a `UNIQUE` constraint is in place, the database automatically enforces it by rejecting any insert or update operation that would result in duplicate values in the constrained column(s). This enforcement happens at the database level, ensuring data integrity across all operations.

6. **Indexing**:
    - In most database systems, creating a `UNIQUE` constraint also creates an underlying index on the constrained column(s). This indexing helps in efficiently enforcing the uniqueness by allowing the database to quickly look up existing values and check for duplicates.

## Example
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    UNIQUE (first_name, last_name)
);
```

## Importance of Order in Composite `UNIQUE` Constraints:

When using a composite `UNIQUE` constraint, the order of columns matters because the uniqueness is enforced based on the sequence of the columns. For example, `(first_name, last_name)` is different from `(last_name, first_name)` because the database checks the uniqueness starting from the first column in the list.
