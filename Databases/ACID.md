**ACID** is a set of properties that guarantee the reliability of database transactions. These properties are crucial for ensuring data integrity and correct processing, especially in the case of failures or errors.

### ACID stands for:

1. **A - Atomicity**:
    - **Definition**: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is all-or-nothing. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database unchanged.
    - **Example**: In a money transfer between two bank accounts, if the transaction fails at any point (e.g., due to a system crash), neither the debit from the sender's account nor the credit to the recipient's account will occur. The system will revert to the state before the transaction began.

2. **C - Consistency**:
	- **Definition**: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints.
	- **Example**: If a database rule states that account balances cannot be negative, any transaction that results in a negative balance will be rejected, ensuring the database remains in a consistent state.

3. **I - Isolation**:
	- **Definition**: Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. The outcome of transactions executed concurrently will be the same as if they were executed sequentially.
	- **Example**: If two transactions are trying to update the same record simultaneously, isolation ensures that one transaction will complete before the other begins, preventing conflicts or corrupted data.

4. **D - Durability**:
	- **Definition**: Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.
	- **Example**: If a system confirms that an order has been placed, the data about the order will be saved and preserved even if the system crashes immediately afterward. The data will be recoverable after the system is restored.
